## Step 8: 

### Changed Files:
* `src/common/squad/squadService.js`
* `src/routes/list/list.js`

### Things to Do:
1. `src/common/squad/squadService.js`
   * Review functions, we have made the heroes array immutable, they have been built already:
     * getAll()
     * clearAll()
     * addHero(hero)
     * removeHero(hero)
     * get/setMaxHeroes(numHeroes)
     * isFull()
     * contains(hero)

2. `src/routes/list/list.js`
   * We want to filter out the list of heroes and exclude any in squad
   * We can use `$watch` to see when squadHeroes change, and then create a modified list of heroes on scope called `noSquadHeroes`
   * Give the `heroList` this new `noSquadHeroes list
